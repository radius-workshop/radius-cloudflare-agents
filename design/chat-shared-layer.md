# Chat Shared Layer

Shared streaming, persistence, and protocol primitives for the `cf_agent_chat_*` WebSocket protocol. Lives in `packages/agents/src/chat/` and is consumed by both `@cloudflare/ai-chat` (the stable chat agent) and `@cloudflare/think` (the opinionated assistant base class).

## Problem

`@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think` both implement the same WebSocket chat protocol and share fundamental streaming/persistence concerns, but they live in separate packages with no shared code path. Think was forced to **fork** `message-builder.ts` (with a drift warning comment) and reimplement sanitization because `agents` — the only package both depend on — didn't have these primitives.

This led to:

- **Duplicated chunk-to-message logic** (`applyChunkToParts`) across two packages, with a comment warning about drift risk
- **Duplicated sanitization** (OpenAI metadata stripping, row-size enforcement) with subtle behavioral differences
- **Duplicated wire protocol constants** (`MSG_CHAT_*` strings matching `MessageType` values)
- **Duplicated metadata handling** (the `start`/`finish`/`message-metadata` switch that `applyChunkToParts` doesn't cover) in three separate code paths: ai-chat server, ai-chat client, and Think server

On the ai-chat side, `index.ts` (~3700 lines) and `react.tsx` (~1577 lines) mixed too many concerns together — streaming, reconciliation, persistence, broadcasting, turn management — making the code difficult to modify and reason about.

  extensions/                      ExtensionManager, HostBridgeLoopback (standalone)
```

**Dependency direction**: `ai-chat → agents`, `think → agents`. The shared layer resolves the circular dependency that caused the original fork.

## Modules

### message-builder.ts

**`applyChunkToParts(parts, chunk) → boolean`** — the core chunk-to-message-part builder. Mutates a `UIMessage["parts"]` array in place for streaming performance. Returns `true` if the chunk type was recognized, `false` for types the caller must handle (`start`, `finish`, `message-metadata`, `error`, `finish-step`).

This is the single most shared piece of code in the chat system. Used by:

- `AIChatAgent._streamSSEReply` — server-side SSE parsing
- `AIChatAgent._persistOrphanedStream` — rebuilding messages from stored chunks after hibernation
- `StreamAccumulator.applyChunk` — the higher-level wrapper
- Think's `StreamAccumulator` usage in `_streamResult` and `chat()`

**Key type: `StreamChunkData`** — deliberately loose (index signature, many optionals) to match the wire format without encoding chunk-type-specific constraints. The `messageMetadata` field is typed as `unknown` (not `Record<string, unknown>`) to match `UIMessageChunk` from the AI SDK.

### sanitize.ts

Two functions for persistence hygiene:

**`sanitizeMessage(message) → UIMessage`** — strips OpenAI ephemeral fields (`itemId`, `reasoningEncryptedContent`) from `providerMetadata` and `callProviderMetadata`, then filters truly empty reasoning parts (no text and no remaining provider metadata after stripping).

**`enforceRowSizeLimit(message) → UIMessage`** — compacts messages exceeding 1.8MB (the safety threshold below SQLite's 2MB row limit). Two-pass: first compact tool outputs over 1KB, then truncate text parts.

`@cloudflare/ai-chat` wraps these with additional logic:

- `_truncateProviderExecutedToolPayloads` — truncates large strings in Anthropic-style server-executed tool payloads (code_execution, text_editor)
- `sanitizeMessageForPersistence()` — protected hook for subclass customization
- `_enforceRowSizeLimit` — adds `console.warn` logging and `metadata.compactedToolOutputs` / `metadata.compactedTextParts` tracking

Think uses the shared functions directly (no extra steps).

### stream-accumulator.ts

**`StreamAccumulator`** — wraps `applyChunkToParts` and handles the chunk types it returns `false` for. Manages `messageId`, `parts`, and `metadata` as a coherent unit.

```typescript
class StreamAccumulator {
  messageId: string;
  readonly parts: UIMessage["parts"];
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;

  applyChunk(chunk: StreamChunkData): ChunkResult;
  toMessage(): UIMessage;
  mergeInto(messages: UIMessage[]): UIMessage[];
}
```

**`ChunkResult`** carries an optional **`ChunkAction`** — a discriminated union that signals domain-specific concerns without the accumulator knowing about them:

| Action type                 | When                                                                                  | Caller handles                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                     | `start` chunk with optional `messageId` / `messageMetadata`                           | ai-chat: may overwrite `message.id`                                     |
| `finish`                    | `finish` chunk with optional `finishReason`                                           | ai-chat: normalize `finishReason` to `messageMetadata` before broadcast |
| `message-metadata`          | `message-metadata` chunk                                                              | Metadata already merged by accumulator                                  |
| `tool-approval-request`     | `tool-approval-request` chunk                                                         | ai-chat: early persist to SQLite for page-refresh survival              |
| `cross-message-tool-update` | `tool-output-available` / `tool-output-error` for a `toolCallId` not in current parts | ai-chat: search `this.messages` and update persisted message            |
| `error`                     | `error` chunk                                                                         | Think: broadcast error frame, `continue`; ai-chat: broadcast error      |

**`mergeInto(messages)`** — produces a new message array by finding an existing message (by `messageId`, or walking backward for last assistant in continuation mode), then replacing or appending. This replaced the `flushActiveStreamToMessages` function on the client and the `activeStreamRef` + metadata merge pattern.

**Where the accumulator is used vs. not:**

- **ai-chat client** (`react.tsx`): Uses `StreamAccumulator` for broadcast/resume streams. The transport-owned path (local tab requests) still goes through `useChat`'s built-in pipeline.
- **Think server**: Uses `StreamAccumulator` in both `_streamResult` (WebSocket path) and `chat()` (RPC sub-agent path).
- **ai-chat server** (`_streamSSEReply`): Still uses `applyChunkToParts` directly. The server's streaming message (`_streamingMessage`) is shared by reference with `hasPendingInteraction`, `_messagesForClientSync`, and `_findAndUpdateToolPart`, making it impractical to route through the accumulator without a deeper refactoring of the shared mutable state.

### protocol.ts

**`CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES`** — plain string constants for the wire protocol message types. Used by Think to avoid depending on `@cloudflare/ai-chat/types` (which would create a dependency edge Think shouldn't have). The values match `MessageType` in `ai-chat/src/types.ts`.

### message-reconciler.ts (ai-chat only)

Pure functions for aligning client messages with server state during persistence. Think doesn't need these — its `INSERT OR IGNORE` + reload-from-DB model avoids the ID reconciliation problem entirely.

**`reconcileMessages(incoming, serverMessages, sanitize?)`** — two-stage pipeline:

1. **Tool output merge**: When the server has `output-available` for a tool that the client still shows as `input-available`, `approval-requested`, or `approval-responded`, adopt the server's output. This handles the case where the client sends stale tool states.

2. **ID reconciliation** (two-pass):
   - Pass 1: Exact ID matches between incoming and server, claiming server indices
   - Pass 2: Content-key matching for non-tool assistant messages using JSON-serialized sanitized parts. Prevents duplicate rows when the AI SDK assigns a different local ID than the server.

**`resolveToolMergeId(message, serverMessages)`** — per-message ID resolution by `toolCallId`. If a tool call ID exists in a server message with a different ID, adopt the server's ID. Called during persistence to prevent duplicate rows.

## Key decisions

### Why `agents/chat` and not a new package

Both `ai-chat` and `think` already depend on `agents`. Adding a new package would create another dependency edge and another build/publish step. The `agents` package already has subdirectory exports (`agents/mcp`, `agents/react`, etc.), so `agents/chat` follows the established pattern.

### Why the accumulator signals actions instead of handling them

The accumulator doesn't know about SQLite, WebSockets, or broadcasting. It signals via `ChunkAction` and the caller decides what to do. This keeps the accumulator testable as a pure data structure and reusable across contexts that handle actions differently (server persists to SQLite on approval, client ignores it; server broadcasts errors on the wire, client logs them).

### Why `_streamSSEReply` was not refactored to use the accumulator

`_streamSSEReply` in ai-chat's server mutates a `message` object that is shared by reference as `this._streamingMessage`. Other methods read this reference to check for pending tool interactions, build client sync payloads, and apply tool results during streaming. Routing through a `StreamAccumulator` would require either:

1. Sharing the same parts array between the accumulator and the message object (breaking the accumulator's encapsulation)
2. Syncing the accumulator's state back to the message after each chunk (adding complexity, not removing it)
3. Refactoring all consumers of `_streamingMessage` to read from the accumulator (a much larger change)

None of these reduce complexity. The metadata handling on the server is ~30 lines of straightforward switch/case that matches the accumulator's behavior exactly. The cost of duplication is low; the risk of the refactoring is high.

### Why reconciliation stays in ai-chat

Think avoids the reconciliation problem entirely through its persistence model: user messages use `INSERT OR IGNORE` (idempotent), assistant messages use `INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE`, and the authoritative message list is always reloaded from SQLite. There's no client/server ID mismatch because Think controls the full lifecycle.

`AIChatAgent` can't do this because it must accept whatever IDs the AI SDK generates on the client side, and the `useChat` hook's internal state management can produce ID mismatches during streaming, tool interactions, and page refreshes.

### Why `StreamChunkData.messageMetadata` is `unknown`

The AI SDK's `UIMessageChunk` types `messageMetadata` as `unknown`. If `StreamChunkData` used `Record<string, unknown>`, passing a `UIMessageChunk` directly to `applyChunkToParts` would fail type checking. The accumulator uses an `asMetadata()` helper to safely narrow `unknown` to `Record<string, unknown>` at runtime.

## Tradeoffs

**Shared `enforceRowSizeLimit` lacks ai-chat's observability features.** The shared version doesn't add `metadata.compactedToolOutputs` or `console.warn` on compaction. Think gets the simpler version; ai-chat wraps it with its own enhanced version. If Think ever needs compaction observability, the shared function could accept an options bag.

**The accumulator creates a new message on every `toMessage()` / `mergeInto()` call.** This is intentional for immutability (React needs new references for re-renders), but it means the server can't use `toMessage()` for its shared `_streamingMessage` reference without breaking identity.

**Wire protocol constants are duplicated between `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES` and `MessageType`.** The values are identical strings but live in two places. `MessageType` is `@cloudflare/ai-chat`'s published enum; `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES` is `agents`'s internal constants. Drift is the operational risk. A future consolidation could move the canonical values to `agents/chat` and have `ai-chat` re-export them, but that requires `ai-chat` to depend on the specific export path — a semver-sensitive change.

## What's next

### TurnQueue (done)

`TurnQueue` — a serial async queue with generation-based invalidation — now lives in `agents/chat/turn-queue.ts`. It handles:

- Promise-chain serialization (FIFO)
- Generation counter with `reset()` (maps to ai-chat's epoch and Think's former `_clearGeneration`)
- Auto-skip of stale entries (generation mismatch at the front of the queue)
- Active request tracking (`activeRequestId`, `isActive`)
- `waitForIdle()` — resolves when the queue is fully drained
- Per-generation queued counts (`queuedCount()`)

```typescript
class TurnQueue {
  get generation(): number;
  get activeRequestId(): string | null;
  get isActive(): boolean;
  enqueue<T>(
    requestId: string,
    fn: () => Promise<T>,
    options?: EnqueueOptions
  ): Promise<TurnResult<T>>;
  reset(): void;
  waitForIdle(): Promise<void>;
  queuedCount(generation?: number): number;
}
```

**AIChatAgent** uses it through `_runExclusiveChatTurn`, which wraps `_turnQueue.enqueue()` with the `onChatResponse` drain and merge-map cleanup. Concurrency policies (drop/latest/merge/debounce) remain in AIChatAgent — they operate on message-specific state the queue doesn't know about. The `onStale` callback on `_runExclusiveChatTurn` lets the WS submit call site send a `done:true` response for turns skipped by auto-skip.

**Think** wraps both `chat()` and `_handleChatRequest` in `_turnQueue.enqueue()`, giving it proper turn serialization (previously concurrent calls could interleave on `this.messages`). `_clearGeneration` was replaced by `_turnQueue.generation`.

**Fields moved from AIChatAgent to TurnQueue:** `_chatTurnQueue`, `_activeChatTurnRequestId`, `_chatEpoch`, `_queuedChatTurnCountsByEpoch`.

**Fields that stayed in AIChatAgent:** `_mergeQueuedUserStartIndexByEpoch`, `_submitSequence` / `_latestOverlappingSubmitSequence`, `_activeDebounceTimer` / `_activeDebounceResolve`, `_pendingChatResponseResults` / `_insideResponseHook`, `_pendingInteractionPromise`.

### Server-side StreamAccumulator (deferred)

Making `_streamSSEReply` use the `StreamAccumulator` requires resolving the `_streamingMessage` shared reference problem.

**Consumers of `_streamingMessage`:**

| Method                   | What it reads                                                       | Mutation?                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `_messagesForClientSync` | `parts.length`, `id`, full object (spliced into messages array)     | Read only                                            |
| `hasPendingInteraction`  | Full object → `_messageHasPendingInteraction`                       | Read only                                            |
| `_findAndUpdateToolPart` | Iterates `parts`, uses `message === _streamingMessage` for identity | **Mutates parts in place** when `isStreamingMessage` |
| `_streamSSEReply`        | Truthiness, shallow copy for early persist snapshot                 | Read only                                            |
| `_reply`                 | Sets to the live message object; clears to `null` in `finally`      | Write                                                |

**The core problem:** `_findAndUpdateToolPart` uses **reference identity** (`message === this._streamingMessage`) to decide whether to mutate parts in place vs. spread-copy. If `_streamingMessage` were a `StreamAccumulator`, you'd need to replace this identity check with something else (e.g., a boolean `isStreamingBuffer`, or comparing against the accumulator instance).

**Possible approaches:**

1. **Shared parts array.** Make `StreamAccumulator` accept an external `parts` array in its constructor (by reference, not copy). The accumulator and the `ChatMessage` share the same array. `applyChunk` mutates the shared array. `_streamingMessage` continues to point to the `ChatMessage`. The accumulator is only used for metadata handling. **Downside:** Breaks the accumulator's current encapsulation (constructor copies parts).

2. **Accumulator as `_streamingMessage`.** Replace `_streamingMessage: ChatMessage | null` with `_streamingAccumulator: StreamAccumulator | null`. Refactor all consumers to use `_streamingAccumulator.parts` / `_streamingAccumulator.messageId` / `_streamingAccumulator.toMessage()`. The biggest change is `_findAndUpdateToolPart`'s identity check — replace with `message === _streamingAccumulator?.toMessage()` won't work (toMessage creates new objects). Use a flag instead. **Downside:** Touches 5+ methods.

3. **Leave as-is.** The metadata handling in `_streamSSEReply` is ~30 lines of switch/case that exactly matches the accumulator's behavior. The cost of duplication is low. **This is the current state.**

---

### Broadcast stream state machine (done)

`broadcastTransition` — a pure state machine for the accumulator-based broadcast/resume path — now lives in `agents/chat/broadcast-state.ts`. It manages the `StreamAccumulator` lifecycle that `useAgentChat`'s `onAgentMessage` handler previously tracked through scattered refs (`accumulatorRef`, `activeStreamIdRef`).

```typescript
type BroadcastStreamState =
  | { status: "idle" }
  | { status: "observing"; streamId: string; accumulator: StreamAccumulator };

type BroadcastStreamEvent =
  | {
      type: "response";
      streamId: string;
      messageId: string;
      chunkData?: unknown;
      done?: boolean;
      error?: boolean;
      replay?: boolean;
      replayComplete?: boolean;
      continuation?: boolean;
      currentMessages?: UIMessage[];
    }
  | { type: "resume-fallback"; streamId: string; messageId: string }
  | { type: "clear" };

function transition(
  state: BroadcastStreamState,
  event: BroadcastStreamEvent
): TransitionResult;
```

The machine handles accumulator creation (including continuation context walking), chunk application, replay suppression, done/error cleanup, and produces `messagesUpdate` closures for the caller to apply. Side effects (sending ACKs, calling `onData`, `setIsServerStreaming`) stay in the caller.

**Scope**: covers only the broadcast/resume accumulator path (path B). The transport-owned path (path A — local tab requests via `WebSocketChatTransport`) is managed by the AI SDK's `useChat` and doesn't go through the state machine. The transport's resume resolver state (`_resumeResolver`, `_resumeNoneResolver`, `_expectToolContinuation`) stays in `ws-chat-transport.ts`.

**What still uses independent variables**: `localRequestIdsRef` (path A vs B switch), `resumingToolContinuationRef` (tool continuation re-entrancy guard), `useChatHelpers.status` (AI SDK lifecycle), and the transport's resolver state. These cross-cut the broadcast/transport boundary and aren't part of the accumulator lifecycle.

## History

- This design doc was created alongside the initial shared layer extraction.
- No prior RFCs — the extraction was motivated by Think's fork of `message-builder.ts` and the growing complexity of `ai-chat/src/index.ts`.
- TurnQueue extracted to `agents/chat/turn-queue.ts`. AIChatAgent and Think both adopt it, unifying turn serialization and the epoch/clear-generation concept.
- Broadcast stream state machine extracted to `agents/chat/broadcast-state.ts`. `useAgentChat`'s `onAgentMessage` handler uses `broadcastTransition` instead of manual accumulator/ref management.
- Think stripped to minimal core: single-session inline storage, removed multi-session API, deleted `AgentChatTransport`, disconnected extensions from Think class. Session module and transport deleted.
- ResumableStream moved from ai-chat to `agents/chat/resumable-stream.ts`. Resume protocol constants (`STREAM_RESUMING`, `STREAM_RESUME_ACK`, `STREAM_RESUME_REQUEST`, `STREAM_RESUME_NONE`) added to `CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES`. Think wired with full resume support.
- Client tool primitives (`ClientToolSchema`, `createToolsFromClientSchemas`) moved to `agents/chat/client-tools.ts`. Tool protocol constants (`TOOL_RESULT`, `TOOL_APPROVAL`, `MESSAGE_UPDATED`) added. Think implements client-side tools with debounce-based auto-continuation.
- Think now has: MCP `waitForMcpConnections`, message push on connect, feature parity with AIChatAgent's core chat experience.
