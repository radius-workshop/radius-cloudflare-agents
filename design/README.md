# Design

This folder documents design decisions, tradeoffs, and rationale across the Agents SDK repository and its libraries. It covers software architecture, API design, visual/UI choices, and anything else where we made a deliberate decision worth recording.

The goal is to give contributors (and future-us) a quick way to understand _why_ things are the way they are, without having to reverse-engineer intent from code or PR history.
